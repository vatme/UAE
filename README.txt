The all new and improved starter package for VATUAE. 

This package is designed to get ES fully operational from the start without all the unnecessary hassle to set it up as it can be very complicated especially for beginners.

Items included in this package:
OMAE-Settings.txt
README.txt
VATUAE.prf
VATUAE_1.4.asr
VATUAE_1.4.ese
VATUAE_1.4.rwy
VATUAE_1.4.sct


To get started, follow these quick steps

1) Exact all the files info a folder within your main EuroSscope folder located in my documents.

2) Execute EuroScope

3) Select the VATUAE.prf when the 'Open profile' box appears

4) Select YES to the message asking to make VATUAE_1.4.sct the active sector file

That’s it.


ES is fully customisable but be sure to read the manuals before changing any settings.Dont' forget to save any changes you have made.
